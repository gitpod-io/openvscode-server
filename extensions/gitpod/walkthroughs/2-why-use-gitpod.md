# Why use Gitpod?

## Automated, ephemeral development environments

Tell Gitpod how to install your project's dependencies, how to build your project and how to start it (e.g. a web server). You likely have these steps documented in a `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

Once you automate your project:
1. Start a new workspace for each task you work on
1. Complete your task
1. Forget about the workspace

<br />

## Prebuilds

There's more! Sure, it's nice to automate your dev environment and have it prepared for each new workspace, but with Prebuilds, **Gitpod does all the heavy lifting for each new commit continuously**.

That's right, by the time you start a workspace, Gitpod already installed all dependencies and built your project. All you need to wait for is for your dev server to start - automatically of course.

## Collaboration with others

Imagine this: You work on a feature and your team member asks you to review their pull request. With Gitpod, all you need to do is open a new browser tab and start a workspace for the given pull request. When done reviewing, close the browser tab and continue your work.

You can even share your running workspace with a colleague to collaborate on the code - no need to be in the same room physically or screen share.
