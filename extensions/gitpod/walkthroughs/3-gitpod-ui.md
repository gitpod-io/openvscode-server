# Learn about the UI

"VS Code in a browser" - this is likely your first impression of Gitpod ðŸ˜‰. You are correct, yet there is so much more than what meets the eye at first sight. Let's explore!

<br />

## The terminal

Do you want to start a database? Need to run docker containers? Spin up multiple microservices? It's all available just as you're used to it from your local development environment.

Split terminal windows or add new ones to better organize yourself.

<br />

## Ports

If your application listens on a port, Gitpod automatically recognizes that and provides you with a private (or public if you wish) URL where you can access the application.

On the left-hand navigation, you can access ports by clicking on the "Remote Explorer" icon. Once open, move your mouse over individual ports to access actions such as "Make Public/Private" or "Open Browser".
